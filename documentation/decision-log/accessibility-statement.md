# USDS Accessibility Statement Approach

## Context and Problem

The current USDS website does not have an accessibility statement on the website.

Per the W3C guidance, accessibility statements are important for several reasons:
- Show your users that you care about accessibility and about them
- Provide them with information about the accessibility of your content
- Demonstrate commitment to accessibility, and to social responsibility



## Considered Options

1. Link to the existing [OMB accessibility statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/accessibility/).
2. Create a personalized USDS accessibility statement.

## Pros

### Existing OMB/EOP statement
- It's already written and approved by OMB.

### Bespoke USDS statement
- It would allow for a richer experience for people, as information would be tailored to USDS accomodations and direct feedback loops. 

## Cons

### Existing OMB/EOP statement
- It's currently being reconsidered by OMB.
- Justin Grimes (policy analyst for OMB, serves as an advisor for the DOJ accessibility rulemaking sessions) states: "OMB is actually in the process of rewriting both our long standing web guidance and our long standing accessibility guidance and we were just looking into this issue."

### Bespoke USDS statement
- It could possible take some time to determine how we get approval for custom content.
