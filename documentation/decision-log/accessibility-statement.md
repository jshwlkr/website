# USDS Accessibility Statement Approach

## Context and Problem

The current USDS website does not have an accessibility statement on the website.

Why have an accessibility statement? 

1. Per the GSA Section508.gov guidance,

While federal agencies are required to provide an accessibility statement, we encourage all digital product owners to include information about an organization’s commitment towards providing equal access to information. In brief, it’s the perfect opportunity to engage customers with disabilities by highlighting relevant information to improve their customer experience.

People who visit the website, particularly individuals with disabilities, will appreciate the open acknowledgement that accessibility is a key driver for the website. Users will also appreciate the ease of access to contact information and speedy responses and resolution should they encounter any barriers while using your website or digital service.

2. Per the W3C guidance, accessibility statements are important for several reasons:
- Show your users that you care about accessibility and about them
- Provide them with information about the accessibility of your content
- Demonstrate commitment to accessibility, and to social responsibility



## Considered Options

1. Link to the existing [OMB accessibility statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/accessibility/).
2. Create a personalized USDS accessibility statement.

## Pros

### Existing OMB/EOP statement
- It's already written and approved by OMB.

### Bespoke USDS statement
- It would allow for a richer experience for people, as information would be tailored to USDS accomodations and direct feedback loops. 

## Cons

### Existing OMB/EOP statement
- It's currently being reconsidered by OMB.
- It's very whitehouse.gov centric, with feedback loops going to the Whitehouse switchboard.
- Justin Grimes (policy analyst for OMB, serves as an advisor for the DOJ accessibility rulemaking sessions) states: "OMB is actually in the process of rewriting both our long standing web guidance and our long standing accessibility guidance and we were just looking into this issue."

### Bespoke USDS statement
- It could take longer to determine how we get approval for custom content internally and from OMB.

## Internal Guidence

USDS meeting set for Jan. 26th to discuss the following:
- How do we get approval for an accessibility statement internally? 
- What custom feedback loops will we establish so that we USDS can respond to accessibility concerns on our website? Typically this is an email contact.
- How can we iterate on the accessibility statement?

Jan. 24
- Met with Justin Grimes and Cassie Winters from OMB. Cassie is a new policy analyst assisting Justin with accessibility guidance for OMB. The advice recieved was to follow up on whether or not OMB has a specific Section 508 program manager. Also, to reach out to the OMB CIO, Tony McDonald, to ask for guidance on whether or not USDS can create our own accessibility statement or if we have to follow OMB's lead. OMB is in the middle of revising all accessibility guidance, and may be more inclined to let us create something personalized. 

Jan. 18
- In response to my email about accessibility statements for USDS, Justin Grimes, policy analyst with OMB, responded some key points:
- "OMB is actually in the process of rewriting both our long standing web guidance and our long standing accessibility guidance and we were just looking into this issue."
- "As for bespoke accessibility statements, USDS is a component of OMB and OMB is a component of EOP so as you mentioned OMB just points to EOP. Honestly, this is probably less a government-wide policy matter and more an internal conversation. USDS website is sort of an anomaly since most EOP components don’t have a standalone property. OMB/EOP GC, OMB MOD, or WH ODS may not want you to fork internal processes because of possible unintended consequences (e.g., how will USDS handle 504/508 complaints, reporting, litigation). Like does USDS have an assigned 508 coordinator? If you were an agency I would say your CIO or agency head would set internal policies as to what happens at the “department” level vs “component” level and approaches to websites should mirror 508 processes."
